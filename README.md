# CustomSocialLogin
Custom social Flow. I develop the calls between salesforce and Facebook in order to retrieve user data without Authorization App.
In my scenario I don't need to log in the user, but collect the user Facebook data only. 
when I will create the user, I will link it to user remote Facebook identifier for log in.
